# Shell Permissions: Controlling Access to Files and Directories

### Permission Types:

``Read (r)``: Allows a user to view the contents of a file or the names of files in a directory.
``Write (w)``: Permits a user to modify the contents of a file or create, delete, and rename files in a directory.
``Execute (x)``: Enables the execution of a file (for programs or scripts) or the ability to enter a directory.

### Permission Levels:

``User (u)``: The owner of the file or directory.
``Group (g)``: Users who belong to the same group as the file or directory.
``Others (o)``: Users who fall outside the owner and group categories.

### Viewing Permissions:

The ``ls`` command, when used with the ``-l`` option, displays detailed information about files, including their permissions.

### Changing Permissions:

The ``chmod`` command is used to change file and directory permissions.
Example: ``chmod u+r file.txt`` adds read permission for the owner of the file.
Permissions can also be set using octal representation, e.g., ``chmod 755 file.sh``.

### Changing Ownership:

The ``chown`` command is used to change the owner of a file or directory.
Example: ``chown newuser file.txt`` changes the owner of ``file.txt`` to ``newuser``.

### Changing Group:

The ``chgrp`` command changes the group ownership of a file or directory.
Example: ``chgrp newgroup file.txt`` changes the group of ``file.txt`` to ``newgroup``.

### Default Permissions:

The umask value influences the default permissions assigned to newly created files and directories.
